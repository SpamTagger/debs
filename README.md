## 🧪 About 🧪

This is an experimental repository intended host custom Debian packages. The packages are built, bundled and uploaded to the GitHub Packages page of their respective repositories. This projects merely downloads, signs and and serves the packages with an APT-compliant GitHub Pages instance.

Packages from the APT repository will be used to build SpamTagger images using the [SpamTagger-Bootc](https://github.com/SpamTagger/SpamTagger-Bootc) project, and the latest version of each package will be available via a `bootc upgrade` to the latest image. Unless you are trying to run to manually install SpamTagger in an unsupported environment, you should need to know anything about this project.
